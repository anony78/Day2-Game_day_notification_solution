Day 2 of the DevOpsAllStarsChallenge was so much fun. I created a system that sends SMS messages to phone numbers or emails about the game we are interested in. The cool thing is that it can be adjusted to any sport you like to watch whether it’s NBA, cricket, or something similar and you get notified every two or three hours about it. Pretty cool, right?
